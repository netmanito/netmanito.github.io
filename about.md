**About this theme:**

Centrarium is a custom theme for Jekyll, made by [Ben Centra][bencentra] for his own blog. He'd be humbled if you liked it enough to use it as well! Installation and configuration instructions can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bencentra/centrarium).

**About Me:**

Menorquinus emigrant at Catalonian lands. Nerd, geek and some kinda freak, love cartoons, pixels, netart, and hack anything to plug.
