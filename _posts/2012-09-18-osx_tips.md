### Netatalk

This is needed if you want to serve AFP from your linux machine.


	$ sudo aptitude update

	$ mkdir -p ~/src/netatalk

	$ cd ~/src/netatalk

	$ sudo aptitude install cracklib2-dev libssl-dev

	$ apt-get source -t testing netatalk

	$ sudo apt-get build-dep netatalk

	$ cd netatalk-2.X.X

	$ sudo DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=ssl dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc

	$ sudo debi

	$ echo "netatalk hold" | sudo dpkg --set-selections

  

After this, you'll have a file server capable of AFP for OSX systems.

### .AppleDouble Files

If you have problems with **.AppleDouble** files in your server, wherever you
installed the **_netatalk_** binaries, there's a script called
**cleanappledouble.pl** which will clean up any orphaned entries in
**.AppleDouble** directories.

	$ ./cleanappledouble.pl --help

	Usage: ./cleanappledouble.pl [-r] [-v] directory [directory ...]

Scans each directory and:

1. removes orphaned .AppleDouble files (from <directory>/.AppleDouble)

2. fixes permissions on .AppleDouble files to match corresponding data file
(minus x bits)

3. fixes owner/group of .AppleDouble files to match corresponding data file
(root only)

If you need to delete the folders, you can try something like

	find . -name \.AppleDouble -exec rm -rf {} \;

## Create .iso images on OSX

From the Command Line:

#### Show Status

	$: drutil status
 
	Vendor   Product           Rev

	Space Used:   46:37:04         blocks:   209779 / 429.63MB / 409.72MiB
	Writability:

#### Unmount Disk

	$: diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk1
	
	Unmount of all volumes on disk1 was successful

#### Create disk Image

	$: dd if=/dev/disk1 of=image.iso  
	963672+1 records in
	963672+1 records out
	493400208 bytes transferred in 220.611582 secs (2236511 bytes/sec)
  
#### Mount Disk Image

	$ hdid image.iso


## Change Background Login Image

	cd /System/Library/CoreServices
	sudo mv DefaultDesktop.jpg DefaultDesktop_org.jpg
	sudo cp /Path/to/picture/you/want/to/use/image.jpg DefaultDesktop.jpg

## ImageMagick 	

### Resize Image

	$: convert -resize 50% image.png small.png

ImageMagick Command Line Options are 
[here](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/command-line-options.php)


### Identify image information via CLI

	$: identify -format '%wx%h' 001_small.jpg
	** 399x262 (result) **

### Locate database in OSX

Been a *NIX user you might sometimes use ***locate*** when you want to find files in a system.
OSX has also this option but has to be enabled.


	locate Curls

	WARNING: The locate database (/var/db/locate.database) does not exist.

To create the database used by *locate*, run the following command:

	sudo launchctl load -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.locate.plist

This will take a while until database is created.

### Adding network routes in OSX

**route** version in OSX is a bit old, and does not work same as LINUX.
Adding a new route in your Mac is as follows:

	route -n add -net 12.0.0.0 192.168.1.200 255.0.0.0 
This adds network access to 12.0.0.0 network through gateway 192.168.1.200 with 255.0.0.0 netmask.

Now we just want to route to a certain IP address.

	route add -host 12.11.10.9 192.168.1.200 255.255.240.0

This IP is not accessible through the default network gateway, so we add this ***route*** over another gateway to access it.

### GeekTool

**TOP**

	top -ocpu -F -R -l2 -n20 | tail -n21 | grep -v `0.0% ..:` | cut -c 1-24,25-29,103-112

**STATUS**

	uptime | awk '{print "UPTIME : " $3 " " $4 " " $5 }' | sed -e 's/.$//g'; top -l 1 | awk '/PhysMem/ {print "RAM : " $8 " "}' ; top -l 2 | awk '/CPU usage/ && NR > 5 {print $6, $7=":", $8, $9="user ", $10, $11="sys ", $12, $13}'

**NET CONNECTION**

File: ~/bin/ipaddress.sh

	#! /bin/bash
	myen0=`ifconfig en0 | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1 | awk '{print $2}'`
	
	if [ "$myen0" != "" ]
    then
	    echo "Ethernet : $myen0"
    else
        echo "Ethernet : INACTIVE"
    fi

    myen1=`ifconfig en1 | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1 | awk '{print $2}'`
	
	if [ "myen1" != "" ]
    then
    echo "AirPort  : $myen1"
    else
    echo "Airport  : INACTIVE"
    fi


**EXTERNAL IP**

	echo External IP: `curl -s http://checkip.dyndns.org/ | sed 's/[a-zA-Z<>/:]//g'`

**CALENDAR**

	cal | sed "s/^/ /;s/$/ /;s/ $(date +%e) / $(date +%e | sed 's/./#/g') /"

**SYSINFO**

	uptime | awk '{printf "Uptime: " $3 " " $4 " " $5 " " }'; top -l 1 | awk '/PhysMem/ {printf "RAM : " $8 ", " }' ; top -l 2 | awk '/CPU usage/ && NR > 5 {print $6, $7=":", $8, $9="user", $10, $11="sys", $12, $13}'

**TimeMachine LOG view**
 
	grep backupd /var/log/system.log | sed s_/System/Library/CoreServices/__g | tail -n 3


## Networked TimeMachine Backup process
 
1. Create TM backup disk image.

First get your MAC address from your card and create disk image with hdiutil.

	ifconfig en0 |grep ether
	hdiutil create -size 120g -fs HFS+J -volname "Jacintosh Backup" jacintosh_000008000469.sparsebundle
	

2. Enable Unsupported Network Volumes

		defaults write com.apple.systempreferences TMShowUnsupportedNetworkVolumes 1
  
3. Mount the NAS share the sparsebundle  and copy sparsebundle image to it.

		rsync -avE jacintosh_000008000469.sparsebundle /Volumes/TMBackups/.
  
4. umount and mount again remote sparsebundle.
  
5. Go to TimeMachine and select new remote image disk.
  
6. Create your first backup.
  
7. If you think Time Machine backs up too often

		sudo defaults write /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.apple.backupd-auto StartInterval -int 1800

#### Start Time Machine backups now in Terminal. **
  
	tmutil startbackup

## Start screen sharing remotely in Terminal
  
Assume you want to do some work on a remote Mac via 10.5's Screen Sharing, but you forgot to enable Screen Sharing before you left the remote Mac. You're now
a good distance away, and apparently stuck. Fortunately, because the screen sharing system uses launchd to monitor its state, enabling and disabling is as simple as adding a file in the remote Mac's /Libary/Preferences folder. (Note that you'll need to be able to login to the remote Mac via ssh to run these commands on that Mac.)

	$ cd /Library/Preferences
	$ echo -n enabled > com.apple.ScreenSharing.launchd_

To disable screen sharing:

	$ cd /Library/Preferences $ rm com.apple.ScreenSharing.launchd_


If you have a Finder window open with the remote Mac selected in the Shared section, you'll even note the icon for Screen Sharing coming and going as you do this.
  

	#!/bin/bash
	LAUNCHD_FILE=/Library/Preferences/com.apple.ScreenSharing.launchd
	if !( groups | grep -q admin );
	then 
	echo "Must be admin to run this script" exit 1 fi case "$1" in status)
	if
	[[ -e $LAUNCHD_FILE ]];
	then echo 'Screen Sharing is enabled';
	exit 0;
	else echo 'Screen Sharing is not enabled';
	exit 1 fi ;; start)
	echo -n enabled > $LAUNCHD_FILE ;; stop) rm -f $LAUNCHD_FILE ;; *) 	
	echo "Usage: $0 {status|start|stop}"
	esac
  
Now, to add a bunch of buttons that are also found in Apple Remote Desktop,
type in this command (it is one line):
  
	defaults write com.apple.ScreenSharing \'NSToolbar Configuration ControlToolbar' -dict-add 'TB Item Identifiers' \'(Scale,Control,Share,Curtain ,Capture,FullScreen,GetClipboard,SendClipboard,Quality)'

## Useful tips

**RSYNC in OSX**  
  
The rsync utility offers substantial improvements in performance when making backups of large file hierarchies.

To copy extended attributes with it, you must specify the -E flag. You can use rsync across a network to make centralized backups.

-E is just for the Mac OS X version of rsync 2.6.9, in the rsync 3 family, it is replaced by the -X flag.  
  
**Rebuild Spotlight index**  

	sudo mdutil -s / (shows status)

	sudo mdutil -i on / (activation)
	
	rm -rf /.Spotlight*
	
	sudo mdutil -E / (rebuild)

Little Script for autoindexing.

	#!/bin/sh
	sleep 1 # let things settle down a bit
	if mdutil -s "/Volumes/stuff" | grep -q "Indexing Disabled" ; 
	then
	mdutil -i on "/Volumes/stuff" >/dev/null
	fi

**Get Mac serial number through command line **  

	ioreg -l | awk '/IOPlatformSerialNumber/ { print $4; }'
  
**Get Mac Hardware info through command line**


	system_profiler | less

**Dashboard Disable**  

	defaults write com.apple.dashboard mcx-disabled -boolean YES

**DNS Flush cache**  
	
	sudo dscacheutil -flushcache
